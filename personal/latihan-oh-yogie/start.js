// a wise man once said "an epic journey starts from a single step"

// for this exercise, I want you to use variables and utilize the aritmetic, comparison, logical, and string operators
// using the console.log, print something that utilize those operators.
// you can make as many as you want, but I expect one each from the aritmetic, comparison, logical, and string operators.
// after you're done, I want you to push your code to your own branch that named after your name.

//example:

//  let a = 1
//  const b = 2
//  console.log(a+b)

// const c = 10
// const d = "10"
// console.log(c>d)
